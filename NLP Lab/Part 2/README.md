The task was to create Seq2Seq NMT system for RU-EN language pair using at least 3 different approaches.
[Baseline solution](https://github.com/girafe-ai/ml-mipt/blob/21f_advanced/homeworks_advanced/lab01_nlp/lab1_02_nlp_part2_nmt.ipynb)
was provided.

Solutions presented are inspired by baseline solution, great [series](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq) of Seq2Seq tutorials by
[bentrevett](https://github.com/bentrevett) and partially inspired by gorgeous [tutotials](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification)
dedicated to image classification by the same author.

The solution consists of 4 main parts. Ones denoted by numbers are NMT models based on different architectures and using various learning techniques.
The last part is [results]() where summary of all experiments provided.
